# What is Angular?

## What is Angular

Angular is an open-source front-end framework made by the Angular team at Google. Angular focuses on creating single page applications \(SPA\) much like ReactJS and Vuejs. It let's you make some cool stuff.

### Angular 2+ differs from Angular 1 \(AngularJS\)

Angular 2 \(or just Angular and, just called Angular for the rest of this book\) was a complete re-write of Angular 1 and had many differences in the general architecture design of the framework. Each successive update to Angular 2 used the terms Angular 3, Angular 4, etc. Angular 1 stops active development on June 30, 2018 and will be deprecated June 30, 2021. The Angular team is supporting Angular 2+ for the foreseeable future.
