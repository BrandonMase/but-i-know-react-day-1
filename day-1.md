# Day 1

## Introduction

I'm banging my head against the wall, hoping the next one knocks me out so I feel some relief from the agony that is learning a new language. It's not that I don't like learning new things, quite the opposite actually, I just hate being hand-held through how to make a variable. No... just no. I'm no senior when it comes to React. I'm more of a angsty teenager, knows how to do some damage but, a hard React life lesson can come barreling at me at any moment. I feel like a baby with a diaper and a pacifier when I start a new language. Not knowing enough about the world so I have to coddled until I learn a thing or two."So why learn Angular if you already know React?", you might ask. Plain and simple really. So many of the companies that I've talked to have said, "You've resume looks good but, we do Angular." In my head I picture this man in a three piece suit yelling at a caveman saying, "But it's the future!". But I know it'll fall of deaf ears. So I decided to bite the bullet and learn.

### Who this is for and not for

If you know some Javascript, you're probably golden. Know how to make a variable, function, class? Can google your way through HTML and CSS? Yeah you'll be fine.If you don't know these things then well, you might want to start there. I make a lot of references to React in these tutorials so people that have knowledge in React can see where the similarities lie but, you don't need to know React to use this. This work can't be record, reproduced or, reviewed without express written consent from the National Football League&trade;. Just kidding, do what you want with it, except sell it.

### Let's do work together

If you see something that's wrong \(it's probably a spelling error\), make an issue on GitHub. If you want to add something, fork it, and make a pull request.
